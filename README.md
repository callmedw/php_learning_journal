> Create a local web interface of a learning journal. The main (index) page will list journal entry titles and dates. Each journal entry title will link to a detail page that displays the title, date, time spent, what you learned, and resources to remember. Include the ability to add or edit journal entries. When adding or editing a journal entry, there must be prompts for title, date, time spent, what you learned, resources to remember. The results for these entries must be stored in a SQLite database and displayed in a blog style website. This project was created for _[TreeHouse Talentpath](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/talentpath/)_.
